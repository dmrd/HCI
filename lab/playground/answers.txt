1. Lowest is 0, highest is the maximum value of an integer.
2. False
3. lower resistance, lower time constant, lower value

4. True, you have to squeeze much harder now to lower the counter the same amount.
5. Higher capacitance can store more charge, thus it takes longer to pass through the same resistance.

6. With the accelerometer on the Arduino, the x-values ranged from 265
to 405, the y-values ranged from 265 to 403, and the z-values ranged
from 286 to 418.

7. True, the maximum value we observed in step 5 was higher than in
step 4.

8. By plugging the 3Vo pin to AREF, we were essentially rescaling the
input to sense a signal between 0 and 3 volts as opposed to between 0
and 5 volts by default. As such, signals will have higher readings
when using this configuration rather than the one in step 4.

9. For the x-axis, the values ranged from 80 to 514. For the y-axis,
the values ranged from 7 to 675. For the z-axis, the values ranged
from 149-554.

10. In the x-direction, we measured 3.2 Gs of acceleration, in the
y-direction 4.9 Gs, and in the z-direction 3 Gs.

11. False, the relationship between angle and output is not linear.
