1. I can easily stop the motor with my fingers at any setting. We
attached tape to the motor, and at the lower settings (70 and below)
the motor didn't have enough torque to overpower the tape's
resistance. However, it can move pretty fast.

2. We use a transistor so that we don't need to power the motor with a
variable large current. Instead, we can simply vary a much smaller
current (such as that of pin 3) and use that pin to complete the
circuit by triggering the transistor as a switch.

3. The diode is a safety measure for the Arduino. If there were no
diode between the leads of the motor, when turning off the motor,
there would be a spike of negative voltage, which could damage the
Arduino; the diode shorts this spike so it doesn't affect any other
circuitry.

4. The servo is much more powerful than the DC motor.

5. The effective range of the servo is 180 degrees (pi radians).

6. DC motors can spin with a constant velocity, whereas servos spin to
a defined position. Hence, one might use a DC motor for continuous or
roughly continuous motion, such as opening a garage door. However,
when you want precise control of the angle for the motor, such as if
you're controlling the flaps on a model airplane, a servo is much
better and more appropriate.
