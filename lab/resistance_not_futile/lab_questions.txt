1. It seems that the FSR can sense force no matter where you apply it
on the sensor, so long as you press the sensor on the round
part. However, the more area on the sensor covered when applying a
constant force, the higher a value the FSR reports.
2. Yes, the output of the FSR is a function of how hard you press.
3. Minimum value observed is 0 with no pressure. Maximum value
observed is 1007.
4. The pull-down/pull-up resistor is not necessary for the rotary
potentiometer because the slider divides the total resistance inside
the potentiometer into two effective resistors. However, the flex
sensor comprises only a single resistor. As such, without a
pull-down/pull-up resistor, the voltage drop is always 5V. The
additional resistor is needed to be able to modify the voltage drop
across the FSR.
5. The minimum value observed is 0, and the maximum value observed is
1023.
6. True
7. The minimum value observed is 127. The maximum value observed is
348.
8. False. Bending the sensor in opposite directions has opposite
effects on the measured voltage.
9. For gentle pressing on the wires, the range of values is between 45
and 49.
10. For firm pressing on the wires, the range of values is between 50
and 55.
11. After wetting my fingers, the range of values was between 154 and
230.
12. When the sensor is entirely covered, the value observed is
22.
13. When the sensor is held up to a bright light source, the value
observed is 1008.
